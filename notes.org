notes.org - todo list

** TODO remove primitives, -lm
** TODO make key/mouse handling the same across every platform
   e.g. look them up in arrays or do the same thing for each platform
   not that it matters but it bugs me

* Eventually
** TODO use memcpy to copy to system pixels; remove as much machinery as possible between cod_screen and window bitmap
** TODO premultiplied alpha, proper color blending
** TODO sse, mmx, other acronyms that might make things faster
** TODO unicode support
** TODO window icons?
** TODO hardware acceleration
